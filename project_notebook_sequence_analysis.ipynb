    "The goal of this solution is to calculate the probability distribution of codons encoding each amino based on their frequency in a provided dataset. The program reads codon frequencies from a file and processes these frequencies to produce a normalized probability distribution for each codon-amino pairing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process consists of several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Read Codon Frequency Data: The program reads the codon frequency data from a file. This file contains lines with codons, amino acids, and their respective frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract Frequencies Using Regular Expressions: A regular expression is used to parse each line of the file and extract codons along with their frequencies. The regular expression pattern matches a codon and its frequency value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map Codons to Amino Acids: The program maps each codon to its corresponding amino, fetching the amino (using the previously defined dictionary, amino_to_codon_dict_list). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate Frequency Dictionary: For each codon, the program calculates the frequency for each aminos codon. These frequencies are stored in a nested dictionary structure (codon_adaptation_freq_dict), where the outer keys are aminos, and the inner dictionaries map codons to their frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute Probabilities: Once all codon frequencies are collected, the program calculates the probability of each codon for each amino acid. This is done by dividing the frequency of each codon by the total frequency of all codons encoding the same amino. The result is a probability distribution stored in a new dictionary (codon_encoding_amino_probability_dict).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flatten the Probability Dictionary: The nested probability dictionary is then flattened for use in the main block of the program, resulting in a single dictionary that maps each codon directly to its probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output the Results: Finally, the program sorts the codon-probability pairs alphabetically by codon and prints them in a formatted table."

    "The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence quantifies how one probability distribution differs from a second, reference distribution. In this task, we compare the original codon distribution derived from a codon usage table, the codon distribution predicted from an RNA sequence, and a uniform distribution. The KL divergence is calculated for each pair of distributions to assess the difference in their probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the task of comparing probability distributions using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, we can break down the solution into several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate RNA Sequences and Protein Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We start by generating a random protein sequence. This sequence is a string of amino acids, where each amino acid is chosen randomly from a predefined list.\n",
    "    - Using the protein sequence, we then generate a corresponding RNA sequence. \n",
    "    - This RNA sequence is created such that it encodes the given protein sequence according to known codon adaptation probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve Predicted Codon Probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - With the RNA sequence generated, we calculate the probability distribution of all possible 3-mers (codons) found within this RNA sequence. This step involves counting occurrences of each codon and normalizing these counts to obtain probabilities.\n",
    "    - The function codon_probabilities() performs this calculation. It returns a dictionary where the keys are codon sequences and the values are their respective probabilities based on the RNA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve Original Codon Probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We then compare our empirical probabilities with a known set of codon probabilities, obtained from a codon usage table. \n",
    "    - The function get_codon_probabilities_from_table() reads the codon usage table and extracts the codon probabilities. \n",
    "    - These probabilities are normalized to ensure they sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve Uniform Codon Probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We also generate a uniform probability distribution for codons. \n",
    "    - In this distribution, each codon has the same probability. \n",
    "    - This is done using the generate_uniform_codon_probabilities() function, which creates a uniform distribution for all possible 3-mers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Renormalize Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Before computing KL divergence, we ensure that the distributions being compared are aligned. This means filtering and renormalizing distributions to match the keys present in the reference distribution. KL divergence requires that both distributions have the same elements.\n",
    "    - The renormalize() function handles this alignment, ensuring that all distributions have probabilities for the same set of codons and that these probabilities sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute Kullback-Leibler Divergence:\n",

    "    - With the codon probability distributions in hand, we compute the KL divergence between different pairs of distributions: the original (reference), the predicted (empirical), and the uniform distribution (baseline).\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, we expect the KL divergence between the original and predicted distributions to be lower than between either of them and the uniform distribution, demonstrating that specific codon usage patterns are captured better than a uniform distribution would suggest. The divergence values should clearly reflect the non-uniform nature of codon usage in real biological sequences compared to random or uniform distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an analysis of the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- KL Divergence Between Original and Predicted Distributions:\n",

    "    - A value of 0.1533 suggests a moderate divergence, implying that while the predicted distribution is somewhat aligned with the original, there are still noticeable differences.\n",
    "    - ```d(predicted || original)``` = 0.14047162716213069\n",
    "    - Measures the divergence in the other direction, showing how much information is lost when the original distribution is approximated by the predicted distribution. - A value of 0.1405 is slightly lower than the previous divergence, which might indicate that the original distribution is somewhat closer to the predicted distribution than the predicted is to the original. \n",
    "    - This result suggests that the predicted distribution approximates the original reasonably well but still has room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- KL Divergence Between Original and Uniform Distributions:\n",
    "    - ```d(original || uniform)``` = 0.2256062647904233\n",
    "    - Shows the divergence from the original distribution to a uniform distribution, reflecting how much more structured or biased the original distribution is compared to a random distribution. \n",
    "    - A value of 0.2256 suggests a substantial difference, indicating that the original codon probabilities are not uniformly distributed and are influenced by specific biological constraints or preferences.\n",
    "    - ```d(uniform || original)``` = 0.09069417636570291\n",
    "    - Conversely, measures how much information is lost when using a uniform distribution to approximate the original. \n",
    "    - The value of 0.0907 is considerably lower than the divergence in the other direction, it indicates that the uniform distribution is not a very poor approximation of the original distribution, but it still doesn’t capture the structure of the original distribution as well as the original distribution itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- KL Divergence Between Predicted and Uniform Distributions:\n",
    "    - ```(predicted || uniform)``` = 0.06332186437783757\n",
    "    - Measures how much information is lost when approximating the uniform distribution by the predicted distribution. \n",
    "    - A value of 0.0633 suggests that the predicted distribution is closer to the uniform distribution compared to the original but still retains some structure.\n",
    "    - ```d(uniform || predicted)``` = 0.055725754669781385\n",
    "    - Shows how much information is lost when the predicted distribution is used to approximate a uniform distribution. \n",
    "    - With a value of 0.0557, this indicates that the uniform distribution is somewhat close to the predicted distribution but not as well-matched as the predicted distribution is to the uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results illustrate that while the predicted distribution captures some characteristics of the original codon usage, there is still a significant difference, indicating that the model used to generate the predicted distribution might benefit from further refinement to better approximate the complex patterns seen in the original codon probabilities.\n",
